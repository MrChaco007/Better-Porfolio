### User Story: Hiring Manager ###

As a hiring manager, I want to see what work Alex has done so that I can decide whether or not he should be interviewed. This means his work should be front and center and easy to access. 

If I like his work, I would also like to see his resume so I can view his experience. This means the resume should also be easy to access and read. 

Lastly, if I like his work and think his resume is viable, I would like to learn more about his character. This means the about page should show off his most valuable traits and his personal pages where I can read more about him.
